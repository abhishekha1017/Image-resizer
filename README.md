# Image-resizer
<h3>In my Image Resizer & Compressor tool, users can upload an image and resize its width & height or reduce its size. If they checked the “Lock aspect ratio”, the aspect ratio for an image will be calculated automatically and filled in the field as they start changing width or height.</h3>


<h3>If the “Reduce quality” is checked, the image quality will be reduced by 40%. And, last users can download their resized images by clicking on the “Download Image” button. Remember downloading images is also done with vanilla JavaScript</h3>
